INSERTION SORT ALGORITHM

The simple steps of achieving the insertion sort are listed as follows -

Step 1 - If the element is the first element, assume that it is already sorted. Return 1.

Step2 - Pick the next element, and store it separately in a key.

Step3 - Now, compare the key with all elements in the sorted array.

Step 4 - If the element in the sorted array is smaller than the current element, then move to the next element. Else, shift greater elements in the array towards the right.

Step 5 - Insert the value.

Step 6 - Repeat until the array is sorted.
