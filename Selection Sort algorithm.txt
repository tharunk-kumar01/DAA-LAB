SELECTION SORT ALGORITHM


SELECTION SORT(arr, n)  
  
Step 1: Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for i = 0 to n-1  
Step 2: CALL SMALLEST(arr, i, n, pos)  
Step 3: SWAP arr[i] with arr[pos]  
[END OF LOOP]  
Step 4: EXIT  
  
SMALLEST (arr, i, n, pos)  
Step 1: [INITIALIZE] SET SMALL = arr[i]  
Step 2: [INITIALIZE] SET pos = i  
Step 3: Repeat for j = i+1 to n  
if (SMALL > arr[j])  
     SET SMALL = arr[j]  
SET pos = j  
[END OF if]  
[END OF LOOP]  
Step 4: RETURN pos
